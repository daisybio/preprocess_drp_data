# Gene lists employed for filtering

## Landmark gene list
The landmark genes can be obtained from GEO [GSE92742](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE92742): 
File: `GSE92742_Broad_LINCS_gene_info_delta_landmark.txt`.

Reduced version: because BeatAML2 and PDX_Bruna did not include some genes.

## Drug target list
This list is obtained from the [GDSC1000 resource](https://www.cancerrxgene.org/gdsc1000/GDSC1000_WebResources/Home.html):
File: `TableS1F.xlsx` (List of screened drugs including targets, targeted process/pathways,  clinical stage).

## Paccman list
From https://ibm.ent.box.com/v/paccmann-pytoda-data/folder/91948853171: 2128_genes. 

## Intersection lists
Intersections of all features for the datasets.
