# Preprocess Drug Response Prediction Data
This project contains all the steps necessary to get from the original data repositories of CCLE/GDSC/â€¦ to usable input files.

In [utils/remapping_pubchem_ids.ipynb](utils/remapping_pubchem_ids.ipynb) are all necessary steps to generate SMILES for as many occurring drugs as possible as input for RDKit and MolGNet.
