    "We have the following problem: drug names are not unique in the respective dataframes. E.g., sometimes, they are using different synonyms, sometimes, there are typos, sometimes, there is random capitalization. The first resort was retrieving the PubChem IDs. However, this opened up new problems. PubChem IDs are not unique, as it turns out. This notebook tries to see how large the problem is."
